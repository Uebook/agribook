# 📱 Install Firebase Notifications Module for Foreground Notifications

## Why You Need This

The `@react-native-firebase/notifications` module is needed to display notifications when the app is in the foreground (active state).

## Install

```bash
cd /Users/vansh/ReactProject/Agribook/mobile
npm install @react-native-firebase/notifications
```

## For Android

After installing, rebuild the app:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android
```

## What This Enables

- ✅ Notifications show when app is in foreground
- ✅ Better notification display with images
- ✅ Notification channels for Android
- ✅ Sound and vibration support

## Current Status

The code is already set up to use the notifications module. Once you install it, foreground notifications will work automatically!
